To enhance feel of the Scale, I add some effect onto the map.

Below are some of them.

![Feel of Scale](../project_images/sketches/sketch_012_cloudy.jpg?raw=true "Example Image")

Adding a sense of super huge object - CLOUD!


![Feel of Scale](../project_images/sketches/sketch_013_ruined.jpg?raw=true "Example Image")

Adding comic like physic to map like running Giant.


![Feel of Scale](../project_images/sketches/sketch_015_airplane.jpg?raw=true "Example Image")

Airplane! Moving small object for adding reality to the map.


![Feel of Scale](../project_images/sketches/sketch_014_morning.jpg?raw=true "Example Image")

Another sketch adding sense of time to the map. THis is morning sunlight.

In this step, I just use photoshop for effect. For final version I need to implement some of them with particle, texture, color palette or boid.
