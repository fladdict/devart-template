Now we are testing laser sensor detection instead of switching tile.

Switching tile works well however making tile is very time consuming and not proactical for competition period.

We need to explorer another possibility as well.

Followings are some possibilities of making interactive floor.

 - Physical tile switch. Time consuming not practical for competition period.
 - Laser range sensor. Not accurate for multiple object but fast.
 - Buying tile floor sensor. Its so expensice may be possible plan if we win the competition.
 - OpenCV from down stairs. Its accurate and fast but not practical for prototyping. Because its need huge physical stracture.
 
As a research we did physical tile switch and we proofed it works.

Next now we are trying laser range sensor plan. Also we are contacting to floor sensor company.

We don't want to restrict posibilities of the art work in this moment.
