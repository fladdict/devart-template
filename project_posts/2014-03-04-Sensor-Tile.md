Just made first prototype interactive tile!!!

Seems woks lovely.


Problem is time and cost. Making 25-36 tiles until 3/28 is not practical.

So there are two plan.

 - Makking 4 - 9 tiles for proof of concept prototype.
 - Also try another approach e.g. laser sensor for alternative choice.
 
 What we should do is not just finishing our artwork until dead line, but showing possibility and showing proof of concept and technology for the exhibition.
