To add feeling of destruction.

We started initial reserch for Glitch effect.

Three is a lot of example on the web.

At the first we were going to use open souce effect shader, however we didn't find any effects that fits our artworks.

Finally, we decide to make our original glitch effect shader that fits our works.



![Exhibition Sketch](../project_images/sketches/sketch_035.png?raw=true "Example Image")



```
#version 120

uniform sampler2DRect tex0;
uniform float redOffsetX;
uniform float redOffsetY;
uniform float greenOffsetX;
uniform float greenOffsetY;
uniform float blueOffsetX;
uniform float blueOffsetY;


void main()
{
    vec2 pos = gl_TexCoord[0].xy;
    vec4 col0 = texture2DRect(tex0, pos+vec2(redOffsetX,redOffsetY));
    vec4 col1 = texture2DRect(tex0, pos+vec2(greenOffsetX,greenOffsetY));
    vec4 col2 = texture2DRect(tex0, pos+vec2(blueOffsetX,blueOffsetY));
    vec4 col3 = vec4(col0.r, col1.g, col2.b,1);
    
    gl_FragColor = vec4(col3);
}
```

Code seems super simple but effect is stunning!! 

I think the most important thing on the computer art is not just technology but parameter tuning.

At last we decide to use the effect for location chaging on the map.
