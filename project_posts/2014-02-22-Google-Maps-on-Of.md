Yes!!! Now Google Maps runs inside the openFrameworks!!!

The most difficult part of the software side was over!

I use [chromium](http://www.chromium.org/) and [awesomium](http://www.awesomium.com/) framework to embed browser inside openFrameworks app. I spend almost 2days to understand awesomium framework and implement it into the app.

Now I can use Google Map as a texture. (Previous prototype uses screen capture of Google Map).

Below is some sketch of Google Map Rendering Pipeline from browser to projector, its really complicated.
