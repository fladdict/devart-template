The first thing to do for new project is research and sketch.

I don't want to use XCode or Processing as an initial step tools.
Programming is powerful sketch tool, however coding tools and libraries restricts ideas. They define an expression. 

First I use various physical tools like paper, photo, model, blocks etc.
