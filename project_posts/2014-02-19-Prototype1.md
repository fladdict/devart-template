I'm getting understand C++ coding!

This is first prototype of THE GIANT MAP.

![Feel of Scale](../project_images/sketches/sketch_016.jpg?raw=true "Example Image")

Map is made with bouncy spring nodes and really interactive now.

When people walk into map (in this demo, mouse cursor), the ground bounces and shakes with distruction.

I think I can upload playable demo or video this weekend.
