Akira Iwaya joined the project. Now we are duo.

He just finished his final paper graduated university. He is holiday and he can help me now.

He will manage erectric and mechanical part of project. I will consider software part.


What we are making now is sensor tiles for interactive instillation.

16 switches are set under the floor tile and send on/off data via arudino.

The biggest challenge of this part is accuracy. By sandwiching MDF tile and sponge sheet. We gonna make rapid and cheap prototype for snsor floor.
