Great Improvement. Now in app google map fully integrated with C++.
Just wrote JS - C++ bridge code.

Still code is very messy, but anyway it works stable and enough fast!

-　Map can move with drag.
-　Zoom In and Zoom Out supported.
-　Direct location jump supported. Barbican, Sanfrancisco Google, and Tokyo.
