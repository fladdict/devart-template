This is first version of THE GIANT MAP made with C++, open frameworks.

This enhanced google map will be projected on the floor with pressure sensor grids.

When people step into the map, the map dinamically react humans move( I hope ).

Needs more optimize and improvement but anyway now I can start phisical / device side of the project.
