As a minor feature, THE GIANT MAP has "stamp to explode airplain" feature.

I just disabled this one. 

The aim of this easter egg feature is to enhance feeling of being big monster.

However I don't want to offend anyone who is involved into recent Missing Malasia Airlines jet issue.

I think art should be something that make people happy, not sad.
