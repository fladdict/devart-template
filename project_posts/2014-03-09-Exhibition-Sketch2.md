Just drew Exhibition Dimension Sketch.

Our desired size for presentation is 5m x 5m square large map.

Technically our app supports bigger, 10m x 10m super large map as well.
Just the number of projectors and sensors issue.

Followings are all gears we need.

 - Mac Pro
 - 2 projectors
 - 2 range sensors or 25 switche tiles
 - 25 sponge tiles for exterior.
