This is some document for competition Judging Panel

I hope it is useful for someone who try this.



## Final artworks files
As a risk management, I uploaded two versions for the final submission. One is for instillation with sensor unit, the other is standalone desktop version.

 - [Final artwork with laser sensor](https://github.com/fladdict/devart-template/tree/master/project_code/openframeworks/TheGiantMap) May not work without sensor unit.
 - [Final artwork - desktop standalone](https://github.com/fladdict/devart-template/tree/master/project_code/openframeworks/TheGiantMap_without_sensor) Stable and good for desktop judging environment.


## Work and Build Environment
 - Program is made with Macbook pro 2013.
 - Openframeworks 0.8.
 - XCode 5.0 or later
 - All libraries are included into project (I wish).
 

## Issues to Know

 - App is made with Openframeworks 0.8, to complie it place the folder inside openframeworks app folder.
 - My friend reported that shader doesn't work with Macbook Air. (I think shader version issue), it works on Macbook Pro 2013.

 - More sound effect management.
 - GUI for Laser Unit position configulation for instillation.
 - Auto restart and setup script for instillation.
 - VNC or other remote desktop setup for instillation risk management.
 - Setup document for instillation stuff for risk management.
