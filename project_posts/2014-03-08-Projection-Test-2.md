Our project is getting real!

Our map is projected on to 1m squre tile.

We tried several material like acrylic, mdf, cloth, etc...
Every material has pros and cos.

Finally we choose sponge sheet for the ground. The point of the material is its softness enchance the feeling of breaking the grounds.


It seems that human foot hides explosion point. 

No problem because final artwork is planned for x10 larger!!! 

This one is 1m squre experiment, but technically our system supports up to 10-20m squre.

Just all we need is huge place to display like barbican!
