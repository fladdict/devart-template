More projection mapping test.

Now our artworks is 2 square meters! You can imagine how it works in final 5m squares!

Fast forwarded time shader and auto location changer test.


Below is what we learnd from this experiment.

 - Tile sensor is too time consuming to make for bigger instillation.
 - Map zoom level that looks good in monitor and that looks good in floor projection is different. Its better to have setting panel.
 - For bigger projection mapping, seems I need more bigger resolution aretwork.
 - Focus and resolution of projection is very important.
 - It means I need new fast Mac Pro and multiple projectors.
 

For final artwork we changed our plan to use laser range sensor, not physical switch sensor.
