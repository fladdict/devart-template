Fast forwarded time shader and auto location changer test.


Below is what we learnd from this experiment.

 - Tile sensor is too time consuming to make for bigger installation.
 - Map zoom level that looks good in monitor and that looks good in floor projection are different. Its better to have settings panel.
 - For bigger projection mapping, seems I need more bigger resolution artwork.
 - Focus and resolution of projection is very important.
 - It means I need new fast Mac Pro and multiple projectors.
 - Also I need more and more bigger room if possible!
 - Technically our plan works! Financially I need to win the contest.
 

For final artwork we changed our plan to use laser range sensor, not physical switch sensor.
