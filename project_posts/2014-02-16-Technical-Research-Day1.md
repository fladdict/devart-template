#Technical Research / Software

Possible technologies that I can choose for the project. My main tools are Flash, Processing, and ObjectiveC. Also I would like to use new technology that I don't know so much. Openframeworks or Cinder may be choice too.



## Pros and Cons

To select a technology, it's better to compare pros and cons.

1. [Flash / ActionScript3](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash.html?promoid=KFNVR)
	- **PRO:** I'm ActionScript3 guru! I can do everything what i want!
	- **PRO:** Easy and fast way to make interactive artwork!
	- **PRO:** It runs on the web. Good for presentation.
	- **CON:** Sadly it's not main stream anymore. No future.
	- **CON:** Less powerful compared to C++.
	
2. [Processing / Java](http://processing.org/)
	- **PRO:** I have been playing with processing since ver 0.4x.
	- **PRO:** Easy and fast way to make interactive artwork!
	- **PRO:** Best sketching tool ever.
	- **PRO:** It runs on the web. (but JAVA).
	- **CON:** Less powerful compared to C++.
	
3. [HTML / Javascript](http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS)
	- **PRO:** Easy and fast way to make interactive artwork!
	- **PRO:** It runs on the web.
	- **CON:** Image processing is very limited.
	- **CON:** Not good at device integration.
	- **CON:** Less powerful compared to C++.
	
4. [iOS / Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/)
	- **PRO:** Device is really handy, stable and powerful.
	- **CON:** It works on only one platform.
	- **CON:** Not good at device integration.
	
5. [openFrameworks / C++](http://www.openframeworks.cc/)
	- **PRO:** Super powerful.
	- **PRO:** Many resource about device integrated artwork.
	- **CON:** Relatively complex and time consuming.
	- **CON:** I'm new to C++
	
6. [Cinder / Objective-C](http://libcinder.org/)
	- **PRO:** Super powerful.
	- **PRO:** Many resource about device integrated artwork.
	- **CON:** Relatively complex and time consuming.
	- **CON:** I'm new to C++
	

## Conclusion

### JavaScript

Yes I need Google Map api. I need JS for that.

This is simple study that shows google satellite map. As a first step I will transfer this browser screen to some other platform because JS is not good for control devices.
