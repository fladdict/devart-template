## Description
THE GIANT MAP is an ultra-large interactive Google Map, where children can physically play.
They can run around the floor and jump around, and this causes the map projected onto the floor to change dynamically, as if the children were Godzilla or a giant messing up the landscape. On this map, in contrast to the real world, extremely deformed physical laws are applicable. This leads to the illusion that you have grown into a giant, instead of the world shrinking down.


## Behind the concept

Changes in scale bring great illusion and a mysterious charm to the human mind.

Very sophisticated miniatures and objects which are far too huge, both serve as the intersection between fantasy and the real world.
Just by standing on their side, the viewer falls into the feeling that they have wandered into the world of fantasy. You can experience the world of fantasy, even without dragons and magic.

Maps are one of the most emblematic results of such rescaling.
Since time immemorial, people have looked at maps and recognized the world around themselves, and have extended their perceived world.
What would happen if we took such a shrunken world, an object called a map, and expanded it again, even larger than the size of a human being?
What if you changed not only the scaling, but also the scale of physical laws?


THE GIANT MAP is a project to explore the interaction between humans and scale.
In addition, as a sub- theme, I would like to think about "involving children in interactive art." Everything should be simple and clear.
